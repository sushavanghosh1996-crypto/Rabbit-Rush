# Wallet Manger

When a set of simulations are setup and executed through the `src/state/run_sims()` function, a new instance of the `WinManager` class is spawned. This class is responsible for tracking `basegame` and `freegame` wins for single simulation rounds (when running `run_spin()`), and also for cumulative win amounts for a given `BetMode`. 

```python
class WinManager:
    def __init__(self, base_game_mode, free_game_mode):
        self.base_game_mode = base_game_mode
        self.free_game_mode = free_game_mode

        self.total_cumulative_wins = 0
        self.cumulative_base_wins = 0
        self.cumulative_free_wins = 0

        self.running_bet_win = 0.0

        self.basegame_wins = 0.0
        self.freegame_wins = 0.0

        self.spin_win = 0.0
        self.tumble_win = 0.0
```


### Cumulative wins

The cumulative win-amounts are useful in the terminal printouts to quickly check the RTP splits for a given multiprocessing thread. These cumulative values are updated each time a simulation is run and successfully passed, within `state.imprint_wins()` basegame and freegame win amounts are updated using `win_manager.update_end_round_wins()`. 

`total_cumulative_wins` incorporate wins from all game-types on a single betmode level, while `cumulative_base_wins` and `cumulative_free_wins ` track the cumulative win amounts for the basegame and freegame respectively. 


### Spin-level wins
The `running_bet_win` tracks wins from the basegame and freegame modes and continuously increases during simulation steps. The final `running_bet_win` value will equal the payout multiplier `basegame_wins` and `freegame_wins`are single simulation level parameters which are reset when `run_spin()` is called. These values are subsequently used for the `lookUpTableSegmented` files, which helps to identify the contribution of different game-types to the final payout multiplier. 

The `spin_win` property tracks the win for a given `reveal` event. So for example is reset for each spin within a `freegame`. Finally the `tumble_win` property is used for tracking wins where there are consecutive win events within a single reveal, most commonly seen within tumbling/cascading games. We may want to keep track of the cumulative win amount resulting from multiple tumble events to update win-banners or apply multipliers at the end of the sequence. 


### Update functions

There are several `WinManager` update functions used to update and reset the `spin_win` and gametype wins. The `running_bet_win` property does not need to be called explicitly, nor does the `cumulative_wins` (as this is called when the simulation is accepted and saved). The gametype should be updated explicitly though when the basegame actions have concluded, as well as at the end of each freegame spin (if applicable). This can be seen the sample `gamestate.run_spin()` game files:
```python
self.win_manager.update_gametype_wins(self.gametype)
```
