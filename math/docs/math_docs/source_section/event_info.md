# Events Module Documentation

## Overview
The `events.py` module defines reusable game events that modify the `gamestate` and log significant actions. These events ensure proper tracking of game states and facilitate structured client communication.

## Functions

### `json_ready_sym(symbol, special_attributes)`
**Purpose**: Converts a symbol object into a dictionary suitable for JSON serialization, including only specified attributes.

**Parameters**:
- `symbol (object)`: The symbol object to convert.
- `special_attributes (list)`: A list of attribute names to include if they are not `False`.

### `reveal_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs the initial board state, including padding symbols if enabled.

### `fs_trigger_event(gamestate, include_padding_index, basegame_trigger, freegame_trigger)`
**Purpose**: Logs the triggering of free spins, whether from the base game or a retrigger event.

**Assertions**:
- Either `basegame_trigger` or `freegame_trigger` must be `True`, not both.
- `gamestate.tot_fs` must be greater than 0.

### `set_win_event(gamestate, winlevel_key='standard')`
**Purpose**: Updates the cumulative win amount for a single outcome.

### `set_total_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Updates the total win amount for a betting round, including all free spins.

### `set_tumble_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs wins from consecutive tumbles.

### `wincap_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Emits an event when the maximum win amount is reached, stopping further spins.

### `win_info_event(gamestate, include_padding_index=True)`
**Purpose**: Logs winning symbol positions and their win amounts, adjusting for padding if enabled.

### `update_tumble_win_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Updates the banner for tumble win amounts.

### `update_freespin_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs the current and total free spins remaining.

### `freespin_end_event(gamestate, winlevel_key='endFeature')`
**Purpose**: Logs the end of a free spin feature and assigns the final win level.

### `final_win_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs the final payout multiplier at the end of a simulation.

### `update_global_mult_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs changes to the global multiplier.

### `tumble_board_event(gamestate)`
**Purpose**: Logs symbol positions removed during a tumble and their replacements.

## Usage Notes
- Each function appends an event dictionary to `gamestate.book['events']`.
- Deep copies ensure that modifications do not affect past event states.
- Events provide structured output suitable for UI updates and analytics.

This module is essential for maintaining a transparent, trackable game state across different game mechanics.
