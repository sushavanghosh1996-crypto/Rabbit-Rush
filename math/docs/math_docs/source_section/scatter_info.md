# Scatter Pays

Scatter-pays (pay-anywhere) games award wins based on the total number of like-symbols appearing on the game board. Symbols do not have to be arranged in any order. Typically a minimum of 8 like-symbols (or Wilds) are required to count as a win, though these values can be defined in the `GameConfig` class. Since it is possible for up to `num_rows * num_columns` winning symbols to occur, it is common to define a particular payout range. For example `8-kind` pays `p1` `9-kind` to pay `p2`, `10-12` kind to pay `p3` and `12+` symbols pay `p4` etc... Instead of manually including all possible pay combinations in `config.paytable` there is a `convert_range_table()` function in the Config class which takes in a symbol range, name and payout amount which is used to generate all `config.paytable` entries. This pay group should be of the format:
```python
    paygroup = {
        ((min_combination[int], max_combination[int]), name[str]) : payout[float],
        ... 
    }
    
```
Ranges defined in `min_combination` and `max_combination` are inclusive, so for example if the `8-kind` payout for symbol `H1` pays `10x`, this would be written as: `((8,8),H1): 10`.


Often (though not always) Scatter pays games are also cascading/tumbling. Within the [scatter sample game](../sample_section/sample_games.md) for example, while there are still winning combinations, the board is tumbled, wins are evaluated for the new board, the wallet manager is updated and relevant events are emitted:
```python
    while self.win_data["totalWin"] > 0 and not (self.wincap_triggered):
        self.tumble_game_board()
        self.win_data = self.get_scatterpay_wins(record_wins=True)
        self.win_manager.update_spinwin(self.win_data["totalWin"])
        self.emit_tumble_win_events()
```

The Scatter pay evaluation function also checks for `multiplier` and `wild` attributes attached to symbols. Wild symbols can contribute to wins for any number of symbols.
