# Simulation Acceptance Criteria

When setting up the game configuration file each mode is split into different win-criteria. Given a total number of simulations for a given bet-mode, the number of simulations required for each criteria is set using a `quota`, which determines the ratio of the total number of simulations satisfying a particular win criteria. 

Following the example used in the [Sample Games](../sample_section/sample_games.md), the win criteria has been split into the following unique conditions:

1. `0` win amounts
2. `basegame` wins 
3. `freegame` scenarios
4. `max-win` scenarios

The purpose of segmenting these game outcomes is to ensure that there are sufficiently many simulations scenarios satisfying a certain criteria. For example if the hit-rate for a max-win is 1% of the available RTP for a game with a 5000x payout would be 1 in 500,000 outcomes. Though if we are only producing 1 Million simulations in total for this mode, we would like to have more than 2 simulations in total which result in the maximum win amount. This reduces the possibility of any players seeing the same outcomes for a specific win amount. 

In the aforementioned list `0` dictates that the payout multiplier is ==0 for that simulation number. `basegame` is essentially any basegame spin where the payout is >0  and the `freegame` is not triggered. `freegame` is any scenario where the `freegame` is triggered from the basegame. `max-win` is any outcome where the maximum payout multiplier is awarded.

This segmentation of wins is also used by the [optimization algorithm](../optimization_section/optimization_algorithm.md).



Pertinent to this section though, the simulation acceptance criteria is integral to the `repeat` condition implemented in all sample games. When the `GameState` is setup, the acceptance criteria is assigned to a specific simulation number before any simulations are carried out. So simulation 10, for example, is predetermined to be a simulation which triggers a `freegame`. 

When the `run_spin()` function is called and the game-round ends, whether or not the simulation is recorded and added to the [library](../overview_section/state_overview.md) is partially determined by the final win condition. If the only condition is that the simulation must be a `0` payout, then the `final_win` value is checked. If this condition is satisfied the `self.repeat = False` and the outcome is saved. Likewise if a particular simulation is determined to be `freegame` criteria, at the end of the spin we verify if the freegame has been triggered and accept the simulation result if so. There can be as many conditions are required in the `self.check_repeat()` function. Just be aware that the more stringent the criteria, the longer a simulation will likely take to run. This time can be quite substantial if the required criteria is unlikely to be achieved naturally. For the `max-win` scenarios for example, generally a specifically made reelstrip is used, and the probability if achieving higher multipliers, prizes etc.. is dictated  in the bet-mode [distribution](configuration_section/betmode_dist.md).


## Predetermining Acceptance

While it would be useful to run the simulations first and then assign the distribution criteria afterwards, this can cause issues when multi-threading larger simulation batches. Simulations relating to max-wins for example typically take substantially longer to succeed than say `0` win simulations. This means that all criteria except the max-win are likely to be filled first, leaving the final thread to deal with many or all of the max-win simulations. For this reason, the `quota` in the BetMode distribution conditions is used in conjunction with the total number of simulations.
