# Stake Engine Math SDK

Welcome to [Stake Engine Math SDK](https://engine.stake.com/)!

The Math SDK is a Python-based engine for defining game rules, simulating outcomes, and optimizing win distributions. It generates all necessary backend and configuration files, lookup tables, and simulation results.
   

For technical details [view the docs](https://stakeengine.github.io/math-sdk/)


# Installation
 
This repository requires Python3 (version >= 3.12), along with the PIP package installer.
If the included optimization algorithm is being used, Rust/Cargo will also need to be installed.

It is recommended to use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and setup the engine by running:
```sh
make setup
```
